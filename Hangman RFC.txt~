 1		Introduction

		The purpose of this document is to describe the protocol for a multiplayer network hangman game. 
		This game can be played by a single player or by two players. Each player in the game will receive 
		the same secret word from the server and who ever can guess it first wins, but to make too many 
		wrong guesses otherwise you will lose and the other player will win whether they have solved the 
		puzzle or not. 



 1.1	Servers

		The server will be used as a point for clients to connect to and receive the current puzzle for the 
		hangman game. The server is responsible for generating a hangman puzzle, keeping track of player 
		scores, and notifying winners and losers. 



 1.2	Clients

		A client is a player connecting to the server. Each client connects to the server and separate thread 
		of the server is spun off for the connecting client. The server will support two clients at a time to 
		play a hangman game.



 1.3	Game Session
	
		A game session is when is defined when two players have connected to the server and a new game is 
		created.
